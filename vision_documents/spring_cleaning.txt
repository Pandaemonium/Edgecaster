SPRING CLEANING CHECKLIST

Core cleanup

-   Remove/ignore the embedded repo at C:\Games\Edgecaster\Edgecaster
    (keep outer repo clean).
-   Keep generated assets out of git:
    v1/Edgecaster/tools/path_thumbnails/ and other
    thumbnails/screenshots → ensure in .gitignore.
-   Commit vision docs (vision_documents/*.txt) so they aren’t
    untracked.

Enemies & AI

-   Confirm all enemies spawn via YAML → templates → factory; remove any
    lingering references to legacy manual data.
-   Flesh out AI behaviors beyond the current stubs (melee_brute,
    skirmisher, dive_bite, lunatic chatter, mana_bite).
-   Add proper spawn tables per biome/depth/zone difficulty; drop the
    debug “spawn lunatic+imps on start” once happy with early game.
-   Hook loot drops (e.g., goblin loot_drop tag) and mana-drain effects
    for mana_viper into actions/effects.

Fractal/editor

-   Consolidate character creation custom fractal flow to reuse
    fractal_editor_scene.py.
-   Tighten click/render alignment QA in the editor; ensure
    F11/fullscreen works consistently in all scenes.

Content/data

-   Document new behaviors/actions when added (update
    architecture/strategy docs).
-   Ensure items/factions/data tables are kept in content/ and loaded
    via registries (avoid scattered hardcoding).

UX/renderer

-   Ability bar: keep extending in render/ascii.py (no parallel UIs).
-   Message logging: ensure names/tags propagate correctly; consider
    removing placeholder “Unknown” fallbacks once registry is stable.

Tests/dev quality

-   Add smoke tests or sanity checks for template loading (enemy YAML)
    so missing IDs fail loudly in dev, not at runtime.
-   Periodically review debug.log usage; keep it small and
    rotated/cleared each run as now.

Lorenz butterflies

-   Hacky old system. Replace butterflies with proper entities (possibly
    some sort of spell effect, along with runes etc.?)
-   Better isolate the Lorenz code away from the core files.

Targeting system

-   Generalize runecasting “target mode” so it can be used in other
    contexts, e.g. “looking” from afar or aiming projectiles

Adjacent screens

-   Adjacent “parasangs” should be simulated to allow for pursuing
    monsters, projectiles, relativistic space distortion (??), etc.
-   In general for our fractal scheme, computation in the grand energy
    queue is determined by scale – we care more about what’s going on
    this parasang than next parasang, but we care more about that than
    about court intrigue in the faraway bird kingdom.
-   Unify fast travel with on-edge screen transitions, to trigger random
    events etc.

Entities

-   The few current entities (berries, inventories) are instantiated ad
    hoc. Move to a more data-driven structure in line with enemies.yaml

Inventory System Cleanup (2025-12 Upgrade)

-   Replace flat game.inventory with per-entity inventories
    (game.inventories[id]).
-   Use get_inventory(owner_id) and player_inventory accessors.
-   Standardize item transfer: take_from_container,
    move_item_between_inventories, eat_item_from_inventory.
-   Updated InventoryScene supports nested containers and proper
    headers.
-   Debug inventory spawner added with random adjectives/colors for
    testing.
