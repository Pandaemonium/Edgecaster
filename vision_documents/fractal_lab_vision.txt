Fractal Lab Vision (run-time spell forge)

Purpose
- A rare sanctuary where you experiment on generators/activators mid-run.
- Tight loop: tweak → pay cost → risk chaos → gain a crafted variant for this run.

Core pieces (long-term)
- Lab POI: visible on overmap, unique map layout with a console.
- LabState: chaos meter, unlocked sigils, stored reagents.
- Console UI: adjust generator params (angle/amp/parts), activator params (radius/N), socket metamagic sigils (echo/delay/etc), show costs/chaos.
- Costs/gating: mana + rare reagents + stat gates (Int/Res). Time cost (action ticks).
- Chaos: each craft raises chaos; thresholds spawn hazards (echo constructs), warps, mana vents. Vent action to reset chaos.
- Rewards: run-only crafted variants, sigils bound to activators, biome-tuned imprints (later).

Minimal prototype (v0)
- Place one Lab in a random overworld zone (depth 0).
- Lab map: small room, console glyph '='. Safe otherwise.
- Interaction: stand on console, press a key to “stabilize” a craft:
  - Pay mana/reagent cost (start with mana-only).
  - Apply a small buff: e.g., increase Activate R radius one step if stats allow.
  - Bump a simple chaos meter (future hook; optional hazard spawn).
- No persistence yet; buffs last for the run. No sigils yet.

Future upgrades
- Sigils (echo/delay/reflect/split) with sockets on activators.
- Chaos hazards and venting action.
- Multiple labs per run, lab-specific side quests/puzzles to unlock console.
- Recipes and meta unlock chance when crafting under high chaos.
