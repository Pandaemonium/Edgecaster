-Sometimes when you die, if you get hit twice in the same turn, you'll get two death messages.

-Bottom half of Options menu uses different cursor than the top.

-Mapgen takes a long time, more for some seeds than others it would seem, and causes slowdown until it's done. Understandable no doubt for such an intensive process. Eventually work on a more streamlined process of worldgen a la Dwarf Fortress where worlds can be created and saved, then loaded and reused more quickly and easily.

-When adjusting things in a PopupMenu, the faded background does not change. So for example, if you adjust a global option in the Options menu a few stacks deep, it won't update on the levels higher up. If you eat a berry in the inventory, it doesn't update your HP bar until you exit out of the inventory screen.

-Imps can taunt you from offscreen. Will require a more sophisticated overhaul of enemy vision and AI.

-Under some circumstances that I'm not sure, the inventory / get items functionality stops working. Other actions like Yawp still work.

-Using keyboard controls to select the location of placed rune node doesn't always work right.

-Beggarly Vagrant can't accept a berry, likely due to inventory system changes

-Clicking on the player one time in the dungeon led to a crash, tried to use the stairs??
